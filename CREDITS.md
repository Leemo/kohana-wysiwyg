This software as a key component uses the following libraries:

[TinyMCE](http://tinymce.moxiecode.com)
---------------------------------------

TinyMCE is a platform independent web based Javascript HTML WYSIWYG
editor control released as Open Source under LGPL by Moxiecode

TinyMCE has the ability to convert HTML TEXTAREA fields or other HTML
elements to editor instances. TinyMCE is very easy to integrate into
other Content Management Systems.

[Codemirror](http://codemirror.net)
-----------------------------------

CodeMirror is a JavaScript library that can be used to create a relatively
pleasant editor interface for code-like content â€• computer programs,
HTML markup, and similar. If a mode has been written for the language
you are editing, the code will be coloured, and the editor will optionally
help you with indentation.
